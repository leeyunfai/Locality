Click Me > https://leeyunfai.github.io/Locality/

This is a one page responsive landing site developed after enrolling in the Udemy Course: Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3, conducted by Jonas Schmedtmann. It was a comprehensive and practical course that taught me the considerations to developing a Responsive Website Design. It also enabled me to understand and apply UI/UX theories in Front-End Development for a better User Experience. Overall, it was a wonderful course that taught me a lot and I highly recommend it to any beginners looking to start learning Front-End Development.
